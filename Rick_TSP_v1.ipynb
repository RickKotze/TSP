    "- I feel as though I have reached a point of deminishing returns with this project. Although there is still SO much room for improvement, I think that my time would be better spent applying my learning to a new project (I have another optimization problem in mind. It is a replenishment order optimizer for one of my clients, I have already built the tool with Solver in Excel, and I think it is very well suited to Python.)"
