    "This is the last block of code. It calls all of the above functions in order to solve a TSP, with arguments defined in-line. I still need to package this into a single pretty function, but rather than making it pretty, I have spent my time playing with the code and trying to learn more. I find it easier to leave this as an open block of code while still testing it.\n",

    "- I feel as though I have reached a point of deminishing returns with this project. Although there is still SO much room for improvement, I think that my time would be better spent applying my learning to a new project (I have another optimization problem in mind. It is a replenishment order optimizer for one of my clients, I have already built the tool with Solver in Excel, and I think it is very well suited to Python.)"
