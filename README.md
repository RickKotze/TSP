# TSP
This is my first attempt at solving the Travelling Salesman Problem with a Genetic Algorithm.
This is also the first Python project that I have completed without step-by-step guidance from a tutorial or blog.

I realise that this might be the sloppiest pile of code that the world has ever seen, but I am actually quite proud of it.
When I look over it now, I see opporunity for improvements in almost every line of code, and if that isn't a sign of learning, then
I don't know what is!

Maybe I will rework this problem at a later stage, but for now I am happy to apply what I have learnt here to my next project.

Happy Days!
